# AMS 562 Final Project #

In this project, some simple manipulations on spherical triangle meshes are performed.

A mesh (unstructured) can be represented by a set of coordinates (geometric data)
and a connectivity table (topological data) that forms the connection relation
between triangles and coordinates.
